# Scene Clicker
A [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module that changes the behavior of left clicking on a Scene. When this module is activated, ileft-clicking on a Scene will "view" the Scene instead of rendering the Scene Config Sheet.

# Instructions
This module requires no setup. Simply activating it in your world will override the left-click behavior on Scenes.

# Instructions
- Step 1: activate this module in your world 
- Step 2: in the Scenes Directory panel or in Journal Entries, left-click on any of your scenes
- Step 3: bask in the glory of viewing the Scene instead of having the Scene Config Sheet pop up
