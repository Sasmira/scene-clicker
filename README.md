# Scene Clicker
A [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module that changes the behavior of left clicking on a Scene. When this module is activated, ileft-clicking on a Scene will "view" the Scene instead of rendering the Scene Config Sheet.

# Instructions
This module requires no setup. Simply activating it in your world will override the left-click behavior on Scenes.

## LoFD's Module Template
This module relied heavily on [The League of Foundry Developer's FoundryVTT Module Template](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/FoundryVTT-Module-Template). This is a great resource to get started in developing cool stuff for FoundryVTT!

## ruipin's libWrapper
This module uses [ruipin's libWrapper library](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper/wiki/Modules-using-libWrapper). Take a look at his stuff if you want to develop modules for FVTT that override its default behaviors.

## D20 Day Hackathon
This module was originally developed during the [D20 Day Hackathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/comments/k8ly5i/the_1st_annual_d20_day_hackathon/) in 2020.
